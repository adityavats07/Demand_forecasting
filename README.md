# 🏪 Demand Forecasting for Stores — Dataset

## 📘 Overview

This dataset is designed for **demand forecasting and sales prediction** across multiple retail stores. It can be used to train machine learning models that predict future product demand based on historical sales data, time features, and store information.

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **File Name:** `Demand_forecasting for Stores.ipynb`
* **Type:** Jupyter Notebook (includes data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling)
* **Data Source:** Simulated/collected retail sales data (store-level).
* **Goal:** Predict store demand to support better inventory management and reduce overstock or stockout situations.

## 📊 Key Features

| Column Name                                        | Description                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Store_ID`                                         | Unique identifier for each store                     |
| `Product_ID`                                       | Unique identifier for each product                   |
| `Date`                                             | Timestamp of recorded sales                          |
| `Sales`                                            | Total sales units or revenue for that date           |
| `Holiday_Flag`                                     | Indicates if the day was a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| `Temperature`, `Fuel_Price`, `CPI`, `Unemployment` | External economic and environmental indicators       |
| `Weekly_Sales`                                     | Aggregated weekly sales amount                       |
